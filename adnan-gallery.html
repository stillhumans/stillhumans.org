    <h2> Adnan </h2>
    <p>It was over two years ago since i left my home in Aleppol. The barrel bombing there was like a death lottery. They could come from anywhere, anytime. Me and my brother left our family to live with our cousins on the contryside, trying to escape the constant this terror. But, still we weren't safe. I am greatfull to be here now, but I just want to go back to the life I lived before. </p>
